These expressions are used to perform calculations and evaluate mathematical equations.\n\nIn this section, we will explore some examples of arithmetic expressions using different operators:\n\n1. Addition:\n2 + 3\nResult: 5\n\ncsharp\nIn this example, we add the numbers 2 and 3, resulting in the sum 5.\n\n2. Subtraction:\n7 - 4\nResult: 3\n\ncsharp\nHere, we subtract 4 from 7, resulting in the difference 3.\n\n3. Multiplication:\n5 * 6\nResult: 30\n\nkotlin\nIn this example, we multiply 5 by 6, giving us the product 30.\n\n4. Division:\n12 / 3\nResult: 4\n\ncsharp\nHere, we divide 12 by 3, resulting in the quotient 4.\n\n5. Combination of Operations:\n2 + 4 * 3\nResult: 14\n\njava\nIn this case, we first perform the multiplication (4 * 3 = 12) and then the addition (2 + 12 = 14).\n\nArithmetic expressions are used not only in mathematics but also in programming and various real-world applications to perform calculations and solve problems. As you continue learning, you will encounter more complex expressions involving variables, functions, and other mathematical concepts.\nThis introduction should provide a good starting point for understanding the basics of arithmetic expressions.\n\n## Examples of multiplication and addition of numbers 8\n\n# Multiply and Add Numbers\nnumber1 = 5\nnumber2 = 10\nnumber3 = 2\n\n# Multiplication\nresult_multiply = number1 * number2\nprint(\"Result of multiplication:\", result_multiply)\n\n# Addition\nresult_addition = number1 + number3\nprint(\"Result of addition:\", result_addition)\n\nWhen you run this code cell, it will perform the following operations:\n\nMultiplication: It will multiply number1 (which is 5) by number2 (which is 10) and store the result in the variable result_multiply. The result will be printed as \"Result of multiplication: 50\".\n\nAddition: It will add number1 (which is 5) to number3 (which is 2) and store the result in the variable result_addition. The result will be printed as \"Result of addition: 7\".\n\n\n## Minute to hour conversion example 9\n\n# Convert Minutes to Hours\ndef convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):\n    hours = minutes / 60\n    return hours\n\n# Example Usage\nminutes_input = 150\nhours_output = convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes_input)\nprint(f\"{minutes_input} minutes is equal to {hours_output:.2f} hours.\")\n\nIn this code cell, we have a function convert_minutes_to_hours that takes the number of minutes as input and returns the equivalent value in hours. The function divides the number of minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in one hour) to calculate the hours.\n\nIn the example usage, we provide minutes_input as 150, and the function will calculate that 150 minutes is equal to 2.5 hours. The result will be printed as \"150 minutes is equal to 2.50 hours.\"\n\n\n## Author 11\n\nThis notebook was created by: José Duarte Paschoal",
